          Since 1950, UNRWA has educated over 2.5 million refugees. The UNRWA  currently educates more than 532,857 refugee children and runs the regionâ€™s largest and most successful school system. With approximately 9 million annual patient visits, UNRWA also runs 144 primary health care facilities. Since URNWA is already providing help in these fields, the money we donate will go to medical care, education, and food.
